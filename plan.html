       even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, 
       nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. (John 1:12,13)

    <p class="quote">"With God's help and guidance, I put this track together the last 3 months of my beloved 
        wife Angela's life here on this earth. After battling cancer for 3 years, 
        Angela went home to be with the Lord at age 37. Our prayer was that
         many would come to the Lord" - Preacher Derick Wilson
