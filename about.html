      <h3 class="WWBI">What We Believe In</h3>
      <p>
        The King James Version of the Bible is what we believe in. That all men
        and women have sinned and that only through the BLOOD are we saved. Not
        by our works or by sprinkling water - but by the Blood of Jesus Christ
        our savior.

      <h3 class="OCC">Our Church Covenant</h3>
      <p>
        "Having been led, as we believe, by the Spirit of God to receive the
        Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior; and, on the profession of our faith,
        having been baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
        the Holy Ghost, we do now, in the presence of God, angels, and this
        assembly, most solemnly and joyfully enter into covenant with one
        another as one body in Christ.""
      </p>
      <p>
        "We engage, therefore, by the aid of the Holy Spirit, to walk together
        in Christian love; to strive for the advancement of the church, in
        knowledge, holiness, and comfort; to promote its prosperity and
        spirituality; to sustain its worship, ordinances, discipline and
        doctrines; to contribute cheerfully and regularly to the support of the
        ministry, the expenses of the church, the relief of the poor, and the
        spread of the Gospel through all nations."
      </p>
      <p>
        "We also engage to maintain family and secret devotion; to religiously
        educate our children; to seek the salvation of our kindred and
        acquaintances; to walk circumspectly in the world; to be just in our
        dealing, faithful in our engagements, and exemplary in our deportment;
        to avoid all tattling, backbiting and excessive anger; to abstain from
        the sale and use of intoxicating drinks as a beverage; and to be zealous
        in our efforts to advance the kingdom of our Savior."
      </p>
      <p>
        "We further engage to watch over one another in brotherly love; to
        remember each other in prayer; to aid each other in sickness and
        distress; to cultivate Christian sympathy in feeling and courtesy of
        speech; to be slow to take offense, but always ready for reconciliation,
        and mindful of the rules of our Savior to secure it without delay. We
        moreover engage that when we remove from this place, we will as soon as
        possible unite with some other church, where we can carry out the spirit
        of this covenant and the principles of Godâ€™s Word."
