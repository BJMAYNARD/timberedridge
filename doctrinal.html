      <h3>Our Doctrinal Statement</h3>
      <div class="verselist">
        <ul>
          1) We believe that love one for another as Jesus loves the believer
          manifests our discipleship, proves our love for God and symbolizes our
          authority as New Testament churches. Love is therefore the great
          commandment of the LORD Jesus Christ upon which all others are
          dependment (Matt. 22:35-40; John 13:34, 35; John15:12; John 4:7-21; 1
          John 5:1-3; Rev. 2:4,5)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          2) We believe in the infallible, verbal inspiration of the whole Bible
          and that the Bible is all-sufficient rule of faith and practice
          (Phalms 119:160; 2 Tim. 3:16,17 )
        </ul>
        <ul>
          3) We believe in the personal truine God; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
          equal in divine perfection (Matt. 28:19)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          4) We believe in the Genesis account of Creation (Gen 1;2)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          5) We believe that Satan is a fallen angel, the archenemy of God and
          man, the unholy god of this world, and that his destiny is the eternal
          lake of fire ( Isa. 14:12-15; Ezek. 28:11-19; Matt. 25:41; 2 Cor. 4:4,
          Eph. 6:10-17; Rev. 20:10 )
        </ul>
        <ul>
          6) We believe in the virgin birth and sinless humanity of Jesus Christ
          (Matt. 1:18-20; 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Peter 2:22)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          7) We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ (John 10:30; John 1:1, 14;
          2 Cor. 5:19)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          8) We believe the Holy Spirit is the devine Administrator for Jesus
          Christ in His churches (Luke 24:49; John 14:16,17; Acts 1:4,5,8; Acts
          2:1-4)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          9) We believe that miraculous spiritual manifestation gifts were done
          away when the Bible was completed. Faith, Hope and Love are the vital
          abiding Spiritual Gifts (1 Cor. chapters 12-14)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          10) We believe that man was created in the image of Godand livedin
          innocency until he fell by voluntary transgression from his sinless
          state, the result being that all mankind are sinners (Gen.1:26; Gen.
          3:6-24; Rom. 5:12, 19)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          11) We believe that the suffering and death of Jesus Christ was
          substitutionary for all mankind and is efficacious only to those who
          believe (Isa. 53:6; Heb. 2:9; 1 Peter 2:24; 1 Peter 3:18; 2 Peter 3:9;
          1 John 2:2)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          12) We believe in the bodily resurrection and ascension of Christ and
          the bodily resurrection of His saints (Matt. 28:1-7; Acts 1:9-11; 1
          Cor 15:42-58; 1 Thess. 4:13-18)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          13) We believe in the premillennial, personal, bodily return of Christ
          as the crowning event of the Gentile age. This event will include the
          resurrectionof the righteous to eternal heaven, and the Millennium
          will be followed by the ressurection of the unrighteous unto eternal
          punishment in the lake of fire and the righteous shall enter into the
          heaven age (John 14:1-6; 1 Thess. 4:13-18; 2 Thess. 2:8; Rev. 19, Rev.
          20:4-6; Rev. 20:11-15; Rev. 21:8)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          14) We believe that the depraved sinner is saved wholly by grace
          through faith in Jesus Christ, and the requisites to regeneration are
          repenatnce toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ (Luke 13:3-5;
          John 3:16-18; Acts 20:21; Rom. 6:23; Eph. 2:8,9), and that the Holy
          Spirit convicts sinners, regenerates, selas, secures, and indwells
          every believer (John 3:6; John 16:8, 9; Rom. 8:9-11; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20;
          Eph. 4:30; Titus 3:5)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          15) We beieve that all who trust Jesus Christ for salvation are
          eternally secure in Him and shall not perish (John 3:36, John 5:24;
          John 10:27-30; Rom. 8:35-39; Heb. 10:39; 1 Peter 1:5)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          16) We believe that God deals with believers as His children, that He
          chastises the disobedient, and that He rewards the obedient (Matt
          16:27; Matt. 25:14-23; John 1L12; Heb. 12:5-11; 2 John 8; Rev. 22:12)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          17) We believe that Jesus Christ establisjed His church during His
          ministry on earth and that it is always a local, visible assembly of
          scripturally baptized believersin the covent relationship to carry out
          the Commision of the Lord Jesus Christ, and each church is an
          Independent, self-governing body, and no other eccesiastical body may
          exercise authority over it. We believe that Jesus Christ gave the
          Great Commision to the New Testament churches only, and that He
          promised the perpetuity of His churches (Matt. 4:18-22; Matt. 16:18;
          Matt. 28:19, 20; Mark 1:14-20; John 1:35-51; Eph. 3:21)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          18) We believe that there are two pictorial ordinances in the Lord's
          churches; Baptism and the Lord's Supper. Scriptural baptism is the
          immersion of penitent believers in water, administered by the
          authority of the New Testament church in the name of the Father, Son,
          and Holy Spirit. The Lord's Supper is a memorial ordinance, restricted
          to the memebrs of the church observing the ordinance (Matt. 28:19, 20;
          Acts 8:12, 38; Rom. 6:4; 1 Cor. 11:1, 2, 17-20, 26)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          19) We believe that there aew two devine appointed offices in a
          church, pastors and deacons, to be filled by men whose qualifications
          are set forth in Titus and 1 Timothy
        </ul>
        <ul>
          20) We believe that all associations, fellowships, and committees are,
          and properly should be, servants of, and under control of the churches
          (Matt. 20:25-28)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          21) We believe in the freedom of worship without interferences from
          the government and affirm our belief in civil obediences, unless the
          laws and regulations of civil government run contrary to the Holy
          Scriptures (Rom 13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-15)
        </ul>
        <ul>
          22) We believe the Bible definition of marriage is the union between a
          man and a woman (Gen. 2:21-24; Matt. 19:4-6; Mark 10:6-9; 1 Cor.
          7:2-4; Eph. 5:22-31)
